A user is requesting you to download some files every Sunday night, 
put them in the BACKUP folder and make sure everyone has access to them, 
how would you do that on a LINUX system?

SCRIPT: 

#################################

#!/bin/bash
# Path to the source file
source_file="/home/SOURCE/file.txt"

# Path to the destination directory
destination_directory="/home/BACKUP/"

# Name for the backup file (add the date and time to avoid overwriting)
timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M")
backup_file="file_backup_$timestamp.txt"

# Copy the file
cp "$source_file" "$destination_directory$backup_file"

# Check if the copy was successful
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Backup completed successfully: $backup_file"
else
    echo "Error in backup process."
fi
